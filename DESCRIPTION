Description: Tools for optimal subset matching of treated units
	and control units in observational studies, with support
	for refined covariate balance constraints, (including
	fine and near-fine balance as special cases). A close 
	relative is the 'rcbalance' package.  See Pimentel, 
	et al.(2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.997879>
	and Pimentel and Kelz (2020)
