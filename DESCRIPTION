Title: Optimal Subset Matching with Refined Covariate Balance
Version: 1.1.6
Date: 2022-2-28
Author: Samuel D. Pimentel
Maintainer: Samuel D. Pimentel <spi@berkeley.edu>
Description: Tools for optimal subset matching of treated units
	and control units in observational studies, with support
	for refined covariate balance constraints, (including
	fine and near-fine balance as special cases). A close 
	relative is the 'rcbalance' package.  See Pimentel, 
	et al.(2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.997879>
	and Pimentel and Kelz (2020) 
	<doi:10.1080/01621459.2020.1720693>. The optmatch 
	package, which is useful for running many of the provided
	functions, may be downloaded from Github at 
	<https://github.com/markmfredrickson/optmatch> if not available
	on CRAN.
